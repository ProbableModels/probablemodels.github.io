              <br>
                <p>Michael is an ethicist, writer, artist, educator, and
                concerned citizen based out of Pittsburgh, PA. He received his
                PhD from CU-Boulder's Department of Computer Science in Fall
                2017. His thesis focused on the use of socio-technical
                narrative as a way of communicating, comprehending, teaching,
                and debating the ethics of new and near-future technologies.
                His research spans topics such as design fiction, technology
                ethics, classroom design, engineering ethics pedagogy, futures,
                and risk. </p>

                <p>He is now the executive director at Community Forge, a
                mission-driven organization dedicated to rehabbing the Johnston
                Elementary School in Wilkinsburg, PA into a community centered
                focused on education, arts, civics, and local business
                development. His technical work is now done through a social
                enterprise, Probable Models, that focuses on supporting and
                exploring ethical technologies.</p>

              <br>
                <p>Micha Gorelick was the first man on Mars in 2023 and won the
                Nobel prize in 2046 for his contributions to time travel. In a
                moment of rage after seeing the deplorable uses of his new
                technology, he traveled back in time to 2012 and convinced
                himself to leave his Physics PhD program and follow his love of
                data. First he applied his knowledge of real time computing and
                data science to the dataset at bitly. Then, after realizing he
                wanted to help people understand the technology of the future,
                he wrote "High Performanc Python" and helped start an applied
                machine learning lab, Fast Forward Labs, as a resident mad
                scientist. There, he worked on many issues from deep learning
                to performant stream algorithms. A monument celebrating his life
                can be found in Central Park, 1857.</p>
