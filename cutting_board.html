                <p class="has-text-justified">We argue for the adoption of a normative definition of
                fairness within the machine learning community and end by
                suggesting ways to incorporate a broader community and generate
                further debate around how to decide what is fair in ML. </p>

                  <p class="has-text-justified"> With the support of the James S.
                  and John L. Knight Foundation, we created and produced a
                  performance meant to discuss issues of technology ethics with the
                  public. Alongside a team of 45 engineers, artists, and dramatists
                  constructed an immersive experience that allowed people to
                  interact with and question their relationship with data. Each
                  audience member witnessed a sci-fi drama, conversed with actors
                  and the audience, and played with up to 12 interactive data
                  exhibits. </p>

              <p class="has-text-justified">This paper establishes and
              addresses the current gap in ethics education in Machine Learning
              courses and demonstrates (1) the need for additional
              ethics to be taught within an ML educational setting, (2) a
              structured set of questions useful for identifying and addressing
              potential issues within an ML project and (3) novel course models
              that provide examples for how to practically teach ML ethics
              without skipping core course content.</p>
